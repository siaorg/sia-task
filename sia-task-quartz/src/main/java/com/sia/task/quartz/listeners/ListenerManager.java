/**
 * Client programs may be interested in the 'listener' interfaces that are

 * <code>Trigger</code> firings. The <code>{@link SchedulerListener}</code>
 * interface provides notifications of <code>Scheduler</code> events and 
 * errors.  Listeners can be associated with local schedulers through the 
 * {@link ListenerManager} interface.
 * 
 * <p>Listener registration order is preserved, and hence notification of listeners
 * will be in the order in which they were registered.</p>
