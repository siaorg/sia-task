/**
 * A context bundle containing handles to various environment information, that
 * is given to a <code>{@link JobDetail}</code> instance as it is
 * executed, and to a <code>{@link Trigger}</code> instance after the
 * execution completes.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The <code>JobDataMap</code> found on this object (via the 
 * <code>getMergedJobDataMap()</code> method) serves as a convenience -
 * it is a merge of the <code>JobDataMap</code> found on the 
 * <code>JobDetail</code> and the one found on the <code>Trigger</code>, with 
 * the value in the latter overriding any same-named values in the former.
 * <i>It is thus considered a 'best practice' that the execute code of a Job
 * retrieve data from the JobDataMap found on this object</i>  NOTE: Do not
 * expect value 'set' into this JobDataMap to somehow be set back onto a
 * job's own JobDataMap  - even if it has the
 * <code>@PersistJobDataAfterExecution</code> annotation.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>JobExecutionContext</code> s are also returned from the 
 * <code>Scheduler.getCurrentlyExecutingJobs()</code>
 * method. These are the same instances as those passed into the jobs that are
 * currently executing within the scheduler. The exception to this is when your
 * application is using Quartz remotely (i.e. via RMI) - in which case you get
 * a clone of the <code>JobExecutionContext</code>s, and their references to
 * the <code>Scheduler</code> and <code>Job</code> instances have been lost (a
 * clone of the <code>JobDetail</code> is still available - just not a handle
 * to the job instance that is running).
